In this work, we tackle the challenging task of real-time domain adaptation in semantic segmentation. We propose a novel and efficient architecture, the Short-Term Dense Concatenate (STDC) network, for semantic segmentation. We combine this with adversarial learning to align the feature distributions of the source and target domains.

We also explore several extensions to improve the performance and efficiency of the domain adaptation process. These include Depthwise Separable Convolution, Fourier Domain Adaptation, and Self-supervised Training with Multi-band Transfer.

We conduct extensive experiments on two datasets, GTA V and Cityscapes. Our results demonstrate significant advancements in reducing the domain gap and enhancing the segmentation accuracy in real-time scenarios.
